# snazzy-careers-website
The career website project is a web application built using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and MySQL Workbench. The application allows users to search for job openings, apply for jobs, and manage their applications. The website interacts with a MySQL database using SQLAlchemy, which provides an ORM for defining database tables and querying data. MySQL Workbench was used to design the database schema and manage data. The project was developed using Replit, an online development environment that allows for easy coding and testing without setting up a local environment. Overall, this career website project provides a user-friendly interface for job seekers to browse and apply for job opportunities while providing a powerful backend for managing job postings and applicant information.
